<p>Before I became a student, I practically did not know what programming was and was not interested in it. I wanted to become a football player. I didn't think at all that I would come to the IT sphere.</p>

<h2 id="after">After i became a student</h2>
<h6 class="postedData">Posted on 01.04.2022</h6>

<p>In 2021, I entered KBTU for IT.After that, I was already interested in programming.Noticed how I began to fumble for programming. In my first year, I closed pp1 and pp2 on A.</p>
